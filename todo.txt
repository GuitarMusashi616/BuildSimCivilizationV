babylon early archer rush

rush nearest neighbor with archers and overwhelm


Generate all techs, policies, buildings, etc from DB file
Get yields for all tiles using DB file
- factor in buildings, techs, policies as well


City prereqs for buildings, units
- building prereq_tech
- units prereq_tech

strategy builder
- pick path for techs
- pick path for policies
- pick path for units
- pick path for buildings

- check prereqs by the time you get there
- see if theres any hold up / prereqs not met when unit wanted for example


fastest way to get nukes rush
- max out science, getting observatories and stuff
- get the uranium
- get the nuke tech
- end when first nuke trained
- do on quick mode
- then test in game

how to come up with variations of strategies?
- same tech progression
- same cities settled in same places
- change build order around
- have to check if you can make the building/tech/unit you want / have all the prereqs in place
- get the final turn when its all made
 - also report any hold ups


 bowman rush
 - https://www.reddit.com/r/civ5/comments/mg5iii/babylon_bowman_swordsman_rush_strategy_deity_127t/
 - just rush 6 bowman and 3 warriors? (maybe 4 and 2?) (how many to take a city?)
 - simulate variations to see how long it takes for how much army
